## Content Marketing 
### :green_book: Medium Marketing
Medium is an online publishing platform with the huge active community. You can make your blog there and engage with your users or Medium readers. I want also show you the downside of using Medium versus your own blog:
-  Lower Conversion. 
You can get huge traffic to your Medium blog, but it doesn’t mean that people will go to your website or offering.
- No magic with getting traffic
You still need to promote your articles yourself.

How to promote your great article: 


## Influencer Marketing
Influencer marketing is a type of marketing that focuses on working with opinioon leaders to drive a brand's message\product\service to the larger market.

## :cat: Marketing for Product Hunt Launch 
Product Hunt is a place to discover, share, and geek out about new products in tech. Submiting your product there is a good way to appear in front of journalists, tech people and fellow makers. After submission, the product will participate in the daily race. The race starts PST 00:00 and finishes PST 23:59. You have to get as many upvotes and comments as you can by the end of the day! :trophy: The most successful products appear on the Homepage and can get many honest feedback, downloads, users and PR buzz. 


[Basic rules on Posting](https://help.producthunt.com/posting): how to post or comment, how to ask for support, how to get to the homepage.


Useful tools:
* [Notify](https://notify.ly/) notifies you in Slack when your startup is mentioned online. That helps you to answer\react quickly if somebody talks about your product (feedback, question).
* [MakerTools](http://makertools.xyz/) allows you to create a Twitter list of all the wonderful folks who upvoted your product. It's a good practise to thank those people for supporting you via Twitter 😍

## :bowtie: Building Partnerships 

Communication is the key for building any kind of relationships. Every social community has its own rules for this. Business people will prefer concise value driven messages, when engineers are more open to deep well-thought-out talk. I encourage you to learn these social rules before writing a single line of LinkedIn invitation:

## 🕵️ Psychology in Marketing

## :moneybag: Pricing 
We struggle in asking people to pay for your product or service.
* [How Much is Your App, Skill and Time Worth?](https://medium.com/mobile-growth/how-much-is-your-app-skill-and-time-worth-4386a7613fa1) by Peter Witham. It's more a philosophical read from my friend, who tries to prevent you from charging low price for you mobile apps or any other product.
