## 🔎 User Research
User research gives you an answer for whom is your product. Analysing potential users & customers will help to:
- understand users' needs, pains, motivations and decision-making process; 
- outline product roadmap, key features, UI design and UX scenarios for interacting with your product;
- define the right marketing message (positioning) and choose marketing channels to spread this message;
- make your marketing & communication strategy.

I hope, that I have convinced you that user research is very important. After learning these materials you should be able to make user research, create basic Persona and validate it on real people:
* [How to Create a Concrete Buyer Persona Guide (with templates, tools, Examples, 188 survey questions)](http://optinmonster.com/how-to-create-a-concrete-buyer-persona-with-templates-examples/) by optinmonster.
* [How to Create Customer Profiles to Reach Your Target Audience](http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/how-to-create-customer-profiles-to-reach-your-target-audience/) by Greg Ciotti. 
* [Design-oriented video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B23iWg0koi8) on performing basic user research.
* Empathy Mapping is one more technique, which widely used in UX for user research. This [Practical Guide to Empathy Maps](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/the-practical-guide-to-empathy-maps-creating-a-10-minute-persona/) will give you a good overview of this approach.

You need to reach your potential users and validate your Persona & hypothesis. You can get real users insight through surveys, interviews, online & offline meetings, chats, Skype calls, checking existing analytics (Google Analytics, social media data), analyzing competitors' customers, ethical googling your users' emails & names and researching them on social media:
* 9-min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Nt_KRZWtY) on creating a Persona, when you already have something to analyze: website, followers for your product on Twitter\Facebook, first users or paying customers.
* Simple [blueprint](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide) for conducting a thorough buyer's journey study. It's a bit old article, but it has a nice plan for making user research interviews (study) with current or potential users.   
* [Asking the right questions during user research, interviews and testing](https://uxdesign.cc/asking-the-right-questions-on-user-research-interviews-and-testing-427261742a67) will be in use when you actually start talking to potential user (😤 you must do this).

👆 User research is an initial part of customer discovery process. You should not only research your potential users but also test if what you want to build is needed on the market (it’s called Product Market Fit). If you are not familiar with Lean Startup approach, I advise you to check these resources. It's more startup-oriented, but still relevant for newbie product makers:

* [Doing Customer Discovery video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hriiulBbWck) by Steve Blank. 
* 16-min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBhtb6Hb_O4) from Stanford online course on Customer Development and Lean Startups.

📌 Useful tools:
* Google search ([here](http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Google-Advanced-Search-Tricks) you will find how to make clever googling with advanced search).
* [Twitter Advanced search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en) and comprehensive [guide](https://zapier.com/blog/twitter-advanced-search-guide/) how to use it.
* LinkedIn search and brief [article](https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/january/19/how-to-make-the-most-of-the-new-linkedin-search) from LinkedIn team on how to use their new search (it's very easy!).
* [Pipl](https://pipl.com/) helps you to find information about email's owners.
* The Buyer Persona Word Doc [Generator](http://www.makemypersona.com/) from HubSpot can help you to make the first hypothesis for your persona.

## 💎 Content Marketing
Content marketing is about promotion via content. You can run a personal blog, guest blog or write at platforms, like Medium (or combine it). Focus on how you can help your users with your content. You don't have to be a professional writer for making cool articles. Just give yourself space to be creative and share your expertise.

I encourage you to start doing content marketing by yourself. Outsourcing it can be very tricky, especially at the beginning.
🤔 Firstly, think how your blog or content is you going to stand out. There are plenty of cool blogs in every industry. How are you going to be different? What unique value can you offer to your users? How can you build an engaged readers community? And the most important question is how you will convert readers into leads. With all those considerations, you should create a content strategy:

Devesh Khanal has divided the cost into 3 categories: costs per article, salary costs and technology costs. You can repeat his calculations for your case and get approximate budgets.

### 🐦 Twitter
I love Twitter as a tool for personal use. Moreover, Twitter has a huge variety of opportunities to promote your product — personal account, company account, Direct Message Marketing, Chats, Adds. Twitter can be used for sharing your articles, connecting with influencers or looking for competitors' customers. As you see, it's a powerful platform for many marketing activities, depending on your goals.  

Your personal account can drive traffic to your product and content. While growing your Twitter followers, you increase the media reach you might get. But don't forget, that Twitter is made for people. To be successful there, you need to communicate with your audience just as you would do offline. If your target audience like your tweets and your personality, there’s a higher chance they will trust you and click on your links:
* [How to Get Higher Tweet Engagement? We Analyzed 23,858 Tweets](https://adespresso.com/academy/blog/get-higher-tweet-engagement-analysis-23858-tweets/) by Karola Karlson. It's a long read about what, when and how to tweet. Although the main focus is on marketing industry, the key insights will be useful for tech as well.

There is nothing wrong with automating your Twitter activities. You can schedule posts, automatically send messages and set up rules for auto-engagement with users. However, using automation only 🤖 will hurt your SMM strategy. So mix it with a real-time tweeting and being active & helpful with the community:

I heavily use LinkedIn. As you remember, we run [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/?utm_source=Github&utm_campaign=Collection-Marketing-For-Engineers&utm_medium=Free-Collection) — a tool for iOS & macOS engineers. A lot of our users spend time on LinkedIn, participate in iOS groups or post articles there. I often post cool stuff in those groups, engage with people via direct messages or share my writings. Unfortunately, I do get spam or some random requests from job seekers\recruiters. But in general, LinkedIn works for me.   

📌 Useful tools:
* If you need to grow your LinkedIn connection base, use this [script](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10P2Exz5ctRRdvwOaXkFZFTmGcnvv9L5UbBmfPzqKWI8/edit#gid=0). It will automatically add targeted people from the "People You May Know" section. You only need to choose the keywords.
* [LinkedIn X-Ray Search tool using Google](https://www.lisearcher.com/). With a free account, you only get 100 search results. To get around this limitation you can use X-Ray Searching.

## :love_letter: Lifecycle Email Marketing
Lifecycle emails can help you to accomplish almost any marketing goal: onboard new users, increase sales, grow users engagement, bring back inactive one or build a long-lasting relationship. It's also known as drip marketing or automated email campaigns. To make it simple: it's a set of emails that will be sent out automatically based on schedule, triggers, or user actions. There are four key components for such email campaigns: the right user, goal-oriented topic, good timing and contextual message. 

💻 Let's start with onboarding. The goal of it is to increase the number of users who actually use your product (or free trial) and pay for it later. Onboarding process can be done through in-app messages, live chat messages, product tours, welcome modal windows, well-crafted UX or even phone calls. We will focus on onboarding via emails:

You can work really hard and get a lot of traffic or trial signups. But if your onboarding experience and converting users to customers suck, you will lose the game. 
* For getting an inspiration for your onboarding and product emails, you can check examples from big companies: [Pinterest Onboarding Emails](https://explore.reallygoodemails.com/pinterest-onboarding-emails-2c7fbb0424a9), [Here Are All Of The Emails We Send At Drift](https://blog.drift.com/all-the-emails-at-drift/), [17 Email Scripts That Have Helped Groove Grow Business](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/business-email-templates) and [6 Wearables Tech Email Marketing Examples](https://www.referralsaasquatch.com/wearables-tech-email-marketing-examples/).

🚀 Subscriber emails are good for announcing new feature releases or sharing blog posts. It's also used for sending educational materials or curated content newsletters. All these emails can be an effective tool for growing your existing user's engagement. With newsletters you can gain many email addresses and turn them into users or partners:

## :fearful: Cold Email Marketing
Most people hate cold outreach and everything connected with the direct sales. However, smart user-oriented cold emails can give you new users, partners or recommendations. I used this technique for getting feedback on early [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/?utm_source=Github&utm_campaign=Collection-Marketing-For-Engineers&utm_medium=Free-Collection). On average, 25% of people answered to my cold emails. 😟 I was afraid, that people would write me: "go away with your spam!" But nobody did that. The worst answer was: "not interested". As you see, there is no reason to avoid cold email marketing:
